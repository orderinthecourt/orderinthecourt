### BEFORE YOU INTERACT (BYI)
adhd + cluster b + system (that uses i/we interchangeably) ++ unlisted conditions . these things WILL affect how i communicate and see people, please be patient with me .

if i get along with you im absolutely okay with giving out socials (simplyplural, discord, etc)

i am not dry when u get to know me i promise this is just for the sake of my github, BUT i am extremely socially awkward (we suffer from social anxiety, and are trying to get out of our shell .)

typically offtab, i might not immediately respond (if at all), im not trying to ignore you

### I WILL NOT INTERACT (IWNI)
t.r.a.s.h (transphobes, racists, ableists, sexists, homophobes)    𝅄𝅄    pro/neu endo    𝅄𝅄    petty drama and those who are constantly and willingly involved with petty drama    𝅄𝅄    darkshippers && loli/shota enjoyers    𝅄𝅄    people involved with sh/ed content    𝅄𝅄    under 13    𝅄𝅄    if you are in contact with someone who has hurt me, are someone who has hurt me, or are someone who has hurt someone close to me, i will not interact for me and my loved ones personal comfort    𝅄𝅄    tcoaal fans (i promised myself i wouldn't add fandoms...failed)    𝅄𝅄    pro/neu israel    𝅄𝅄    i really dont need a reason to block you or not want to interact with you, i block/avoid freely

i say specifically "i will not interact" because i feel like its impossible to make sure every person ever in your dni avoids interacting with you, and i know people will likely not see it - so its more of a warning that "if i find out you apply to any of these, i will avoid interacting with you from then on or i might block you"

i will interact with you if you are 13 or 18+ but i will likely avoid getting close to you for my own personal comfort
